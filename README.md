# simpleMath
This plugin gives Sublime Text the ability to perform simple math operations with numbers for all or only selected text.

Currently available commands:
- **summarize**: get sum of all numbers.
- **multiply**: multiply all numbers
- **calculate**: run mathematical expression ignoring words (i.e. `(2 cups * with 5 apples in each) divided / between 20 children` = `(2*5)/20` = `0.5`)

Commands planned for development:
- **statistics**: get minimum and maximum numbers and the difference between them. Get average and median values
